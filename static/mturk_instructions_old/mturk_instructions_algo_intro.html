    We are trying to help health researchers develop powerful machine learning algorithms.
    Researchers want to be able to measure the physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep of the population.<br><br>

    New wearable devices, like smartwatches, might be able to automatically figure this out, since millions of people
    will be wearing them. This could lead to breakthroughs in our understanding of disease and health.<br><br>

    But to get smartwatches to be able to figure this out, the algorithms the watches use, need labeled data. The computers
    need some “right answers” of what people were doing when wearing the watch throughout the day.<br><br>

    This is where we need your help!<br><br>
