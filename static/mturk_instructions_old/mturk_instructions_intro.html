    Researchers want to be able to measure the physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep of the population.<br><br>

    New wearable devices, like smartwatches, track the daily motions of the millions of people who wear them.<br><br>

    Studying the motions unique to different people and activities can lead to breakthroughs in our understanding of
    disease and health.<br><br>

    In the future, your smartwatch may be able to predict what you are doing from the way you move. To make this possible,
    researchers need a lot of labeled data that matches activities to the signals collected from wearable devices.<br><br>

    This is where we need your help!<br><br>
